- commits:

        Use `error-chain`'s `Result` instead of the current `Result<..., String>`
        as a return type. Using `error-chain` will simplify error handling and
        provide better interoperability.

        The code in the `service` module will be a target for major refactoring in a separate issue.

        and now we are cleaning it all up and making it consistent. I also
        renamed the `general` module to `status` module, since at the end of the
        cleanup this is the functionality which ended up there.

    - subject: Isolating dbus-rs usage while fixing connection functionality
- commits:
    - body: A new module is introduced with the intention of creating additional
        facade isolating the usage of dbus-rs. All returned values and arguments
        of the new module API are standard Rust structs or our own structs.
        Internally usage of dbus-rs is improved by using different language
        features. More complete error handling is introduced with the new
        module.
